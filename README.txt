Overview
EmoDetection is a project focused on real-time emotion detection using artificial intelligence techniques. The project utilizes computer vision and deep learning models to analyze facial expressions and identify dominant emotions in images and video streams.

What I Used
Libraries: OpenCV, DeepFace, Matplotlib
Technologies: Python, AI/ML algorithms
What I Did?
Implemented emotion detection using the DeepFace library.
Utilized OpenCV for real-time face detection and image manipulation.
Developed functionality to analyze facial expressions and determine dominant emotions such as happiness, sadness, etc.
Created a real-time emotion detection application that processes live video from a webcam and displays detected emotions on-screen.
